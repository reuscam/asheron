# Overview

This repo tracks lua based scripts for the game Asheron Call.  These scripts run within the context of Utility Belt's [LUA API](https://staging.utilitybelt.me/lua).

Follow [these](https://utilitybelt.gitlab.io/) instructions to install Utility Belt.  You need a recent copy to enable the scripting capability.

If you want to use a script in this repo, grab the folder+contents of the script in choice, and copy it locally to your utilitybelt scripts folder.  Then use the UB script dialog in game to start/stop it.
